# Workshop Widget

This is a Workshop widget

## Exercise

- We have a page with listview of Attendees
- Attendee has Name and Attended
- You are going to create a small widget with a button
- When you press this button, it is going to inverse the Attended value

## Getting started:

- Download this project
- Use ``npm install`` to install the dependencies for Grunt
- Now run ``grunt`` and let this run in the background
- Start the test-project, open the src folder in your editor and start making changes in your widget:

If you make changes to XML or CSS, you have to Synchronize your project-folder and redeploy your project locally.
If you make changes to Javascript, you can just refresh the browser

## Tips

- Use a template. Make sure you have the Dojo attachpoints
- Changing the value of an object? Or use a Microflow?
- Take a look at the AppStoreWidgetBoilerplate, this has some great comments on how to do certain things
